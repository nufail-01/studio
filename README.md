# 🎨 Studio Website – Modern Responsive UI

A clean, modern, and fully responsive **studio website** built using **HTML, SCSS, and CSS**.  
This project focuses on strong visual identity, smooth animations, and a scalable styling system using a **CSS preprocessor (SCSS)**.

During development, I faced styling and maintainability issues, which I solved by switching from plain CSS to **SCSS**.
